# Marathon Sounds
Archive of sounds for Bungie’s *Marathon* trilogy. These are probably copyright 1991 by Sound Ideas and/or 1995-96 by Bungie, but they are also royalty-free sounds for a game that has been released as freeware, which likely makes them fair game to archive here, especially because it’s already possible to extract them using [ShapeFusion](https://github.com/treellama/shapefusion/releases); I’m merely saving people a ton of work by posting the original sounds here, not posting anything that isn’t already available. The remastered and remixed sounds I’ve posted here, meanwhile, are my own derivatves. (If you’d like to use my remastered or remixed sounds, please ask first.)

Nearly all the known sources for *Marathon* and *Marathon Infinity*’s sounds are in Sound Ideas’ [General Series 6000](https://www.sound-ideas.com/Product/42/The-Original-General-Series-6000-Sound-Effect-Library) collection (the “fist hitting” sound is from the [Series 4000 Hollywood](https://www.sound-ideas.com/Product/414/Series-4000-Hollywood-Sound-Effects-Library) library). See my [detailed accounting of the known sources](https://aaronfreed.github.io/marathonsounds.html) for more information.

I’ve also posted [detailed information about my remastering process](https://aaronfreed.github.io/remastering.html) that may be of interest; it contains a few unconventional steps that attempt to compensate for missing upper frequencies.

## Marathon (1994) / Marathon Infinity (1996) ##
The sounds from *Marathon* (1994) and *Marathon Infinity* (1996), respectively. *Marathon 2: Durandal* (1995) doesn’t have a folder of its own because every single sound it used reappeared in *Marathon Infinity*, which added a few more.

## Marathon (1994) Remixes & Remasters ##
These are mostly the same sounds in my [remastered *Marathon* sounds](https://simplici7y.com/items/marathon-1-remastered-sounds-2/). A few are remixed from the sources:
* Body falling
* Fist hitting
* Rocket exploding
* Flamethrower
* *Marathon* platform start
* *Marathon* platform stop
* Energy refuel
* Crunch
  
Variants of the above eight samples also appeared in *Marathon 2*, although it used different excerpts of the sound that provided both the *Marathon* platform sounds and the S’pht platform sounds (incidentally, the energy refuel came from the same sample; again, see my [accounting of the known sources](https://aaronfreed.github.io/marathonsounds.html) for more information).

## Marathon Infinity (1996) Remasters ##
These are the same sounds as I used in my [remastered *Infinity* sounds](https://simplici7y.com/items/remastered-sounds-for-marathon-infinity/). I attempted to compensate for various audio flaws, but the noise reduction, declipping, and especially the attempts to reconstruct missing upper frequencies I used have proved polarising.

I didn’t include any sounds that appear in one of the below folders because the remixes are way, way better.

## Marathon Infinity (1996) Remixes ##
Sourced from the CD-quality samples. I attempted to be as faithful as possible overall to Bungie’s sounds, with the following exceptions:
*	I think I declipped a few of them
*	They’re roughly 6 dB quieter (to avoid digital clipping)
*	I sometimes used longer decays than Bungie used
*	They’re stereo
*	They have a higher sample rate (44.1 kHz)
*	There are sometimes different numbers of sounds, for one of the following reasons:
	*	Bungie may have split one stereo sample into two mono sounds (i.e., shotgun)
	*	Multiple samples were so similar that I genuinely couldn’t tell which one Bungie used (i.e., .44 magnum)

## Marathon Infinity (1996) Remixes (Extended & Extras) ##
These contain cases of the following:
* Longer versions of the same samples from a few ambient sounds
* Extra sounds from the same sets of samples
